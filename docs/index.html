    <h2> </h2>
    <p>
        Here, web page buttons are slightly misaligned from where they were originally planned to be because 
        the iframes here have different dimensions from the Moto G4 screen we were originally working with. 
        Correct alignments are shown in the markdown file, which includes screenshots with the Moto G4.
    </p>
    <h2> In an empty list, create an item "Buy new John Grisham book" </h2>
    <div>
    <p>
        We start with an empty list, shown below. Next, we'll add an item. To add an item,
        click (or tap using finger on the mobile device) on the list space
        saying 'add item here'
    </p>
    <div class = "wrap">
        <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                src="emptyList.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
        </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        The user is now typing in the first available space - it is highlighted
        in a different color to show the user that they are typing there. When
        the user presses enter or clicks on something out of the text box, the
        item is saved.
    </p>
    <div class = "wrap">
        <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                src="addFirstItem.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
        </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        When the item is saved, the highlight turns off to show the user that they
        are no longer typing. The empty circle appears at the bottom to signify that more items can be added by
        clicking on this area.
    </p>
    <div class = "wrap">
        <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                src="buyNew.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
        </iframe>
    </div>
</div>

    <h2> In a non-empty list, create an item named "Eat Lunch"</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The user starts with a non-empty list. To add a new item, the user
            should click on the space below their list, next to the empty bullet point.
        </p>
    <div class = "wrap">
        <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                src="buyNew.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
        </iframe>
    </div>

        <p>
            When the user clicks into this space, they are able to type. Furthermore, what
            they type is highlighted to indicate that they are currently editing & where
            they are editing.
        </p>
    <div class = "wrap">
        <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                src="addSecondItem.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
        </iframe>
    </div>

        <p>
            After pressing the enter key, or clicking out of this box, the highlight disappears
            and their added item is saved.
        </p>
    <div class = "wrap">
        <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                src="eatLunch.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">

    <h2> Mark the item named "Call Mom" completed</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The user starts with a list that has the item "Call Mom" in it.
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="callMomUncompleted.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            To mark this as completed, the user clicks on the circle on the left of this
            item. When doing so, the item changes colors, is striked through, and has its circle
            filled in. Here, the filled-in bullet point is the same color as the text.
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="callMomCompleted.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2> Rename the item "Text John" to "Text John about Bank statements"</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            We start with an item named "Text John".
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="uneditedTextJohn.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            To edit this, the user clicks on this item- this time clicking on the words themselves,
            as opposed to the circle on its left. After doing so, the user is now typing in this box.
            As such, the color highlight changes.
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="editingTextJohn.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            When finished editing, the user either presses enter on their keyboard or clicks out of
            the box. The highlight now color changes back to normal. The process of saving a new item, and saving changes to an old item, are therefore the same.

        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="editedTextJohn.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2> Show only uncompleted items / Delete all completed items</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Visually, these two functions are the same. We start with a full list.
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="callMomCompleted.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
            The list options are located under the only button onscreen: the button with three dots on it.
            When this button is pressed, a menu with three options appears.
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="hide&deleteCompleted.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
            When a user presses on one of these buttons, the menu will close and the action will be completed.
            Hiding the completed items and deleting them both remove them completely from the screen.
        </p>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <iframe class = "scaled-frame"
                    src="hide&deleteCompletedAfter.html" style="border: 1px solid black;">
            </iframe>
        </div>
