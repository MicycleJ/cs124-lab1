## Design Decisions:
For our final design, we took a lot of inspiration from the Apple Remind app and Desmos. We took ideas from both of these interfaces and combined them to create our to do list. We got ideas from the Remind app to have the items of our list have a circle to the left (non filled in circles for unfinished tasks and filled in circles for finished tasks). Based on the Remind App, we also decided to put lines under the tasks as a way to separate them without putting boxes around them. We decided to put the three options to hide, show and delete finished tasks in a three dot dropdown button at the top. We decided to do this to make the list more clean and to reduce the buttons being displayed at a time. We hoped for a minimalist display with a larger focus on the actual list rather than the buttons. We put this three dot button at the top next to the title where we think people will intuitively look for it. When there are no items on the list, we decided to have one empty “item” that indicates the user to type there. Then, for future items that need to be added, we omitted this message but we still have a circle with a blank next to it so that users know that they can click there to add a new item. We hoped for this to be an intuitive and clean way to add new items without the need for more buttons. This makes it easier for the user because there are less things to click and it makes the interface cleaner and more minimalistic. We also decided to put a highlight over any item that is currently clicked on and is able to be edited. We decided to do this as a way to indicate to the user that this is the item that is clicked on. Lastly, users can cross off items by pressing on the circle next to them. What happens next is that the task gets crossed off and changed to a lighter color. We did this as a way to give the user the satisfaction of crossing off an item and making it less prominent than the unfinished tasks while not moving or removing it.

## Alternate Designs:
One major design decision is that we were considering putting each todo list item in a box. This is similar to the Desmos layout. This is what we were considering doing at first because we felt that it was a good way to separate the items and have a clear divide among them. However, then we realized that if we have a line under each item, this could also work as a dividing feature. Then, we checked the Remind app and saw that they used lines underneath each item and this worked well as a way to have the items on a line instead of floating in air but also as a way to divide items. We ended up liking this more because the divisions were less stark while still being present. 
Another design decision we faced is that initially, we wanted to have the background of the list items to alternate colors, for example, item 1 would be green and item 2 would be blue and item 3 would be green again and so on. We originally wanted to do this because we thought it would help with the readability of the list. However, in the end we decided against this because we wanted to have the feature that the item currently selected would be highlighted a different color and these two features wouldn't work well together. We valued more having the selected item highlighted and so we couldn't have the alternating colors design.

Here we can see our original design idea of having the list items alternate colors to improve redability. We also show our final design idea with the highlight for the selected item. The two design ideas did not work well together so we had to choose just one. Here we can see why:

## User Testing:
We asked one Harvey Mudd student to help us with testing our site. We walked them through the different scenarios described in the homework. We asked them to practice “Thinking Out Loud” techniques during the usability test. We basically asked them to talk through all the thoughts they were having while one of us took notes. We prepped them by saying that the website is not actually functional but that we would show them different pages that would display for the actions being described. We still asked the user to physically complete the actions even though the website is not yet functional.
For each task, we would start by saying “What would you do if you wanted to…” and then ask them to explain in words what they would do, practicing the “thinking out loud” skills. Then we would switch the page to the next page of the flow of the specific task. We did this for all 6 tasks (create an item in an empty list, create an item in a nonempty list, mask an item as completed, rename an item. Show only uncompleted items, delete all completed items). After we completed all the tasks, we asked the participant what they liked and didnt like from the website.
The student uses lots of online todo lists. They liked that the interface was clean and minimalistic while still being intuitive. They would have liked that when an item was marked as completed, that it automatically moved to the bottom of the list, or to another location and out of the way. The user also mentioned that they would have appreciated a way to delete single items, which is something that we had not thought of. We could implement this in our next stage by adding an “x” button to the right of every item. This “x” button could show up only when hovered on an item to keep the clean look. The user also mentioned that they would have liked a way to title the todo list, create more todo lists and change the color scheme of the todo list. These were all great suggestions and are things we can try to implement on the next stage of this project. We appreciated all the comments and suggestions that this student gave us and their experience with online todo lists was helpful for providing suggestions.
## Challenges you faced:
The main challenge that comes to mind is making decisions as a pair. At times it was difficult to come to a singular decision when we both had very different opinions. At times, we would postpone making a decision when this occurred and worked on other things in the meantime. Then, we would come back to the decision later, when we both had more time to think about it and state our case more clearly. Most times, we ended up coming up with a third idea that we both liked or one of us would compromise if it ended up not being as important to us. For example, we got into a pretty long argument about what font to choose. We wanted to choose a font that is dyslexia friendly but couldn't agree on which one because if one of us liked a font, the other person hated it. We eventually landed on a font that we both loved and are really happy with. Working in groups is always hard because everyone has different opinions and even though this was a challenge, I feel like in the end we made it work and we learned how to work better with each other. 
Another challenge was that at times it was frustrating when we were pair programming and we wanted to work on different things. What would end up happening is that we would work on our separate computers and reconvene in the end to put our work and ideas together.  
Another general struggle was trying to figure out how to make the html site look like we wanted it to. Some components of this took a lot of trial and error, such as font size, color, grid column and roseIt was hard at times because we knew how we wanted it to look but we didn't know what steps we needed to take to get there. Online documentation was helpful in these cases but at times they would lead you down a rabbit hole. We also struggled with the grid and the flex boxes for a while because we couldn't figure out how to get the different items in the specific places that we wanted them to be. We realized later that we had three separate items in one div and it wasn't letting us put these items in different grid coordinates. It took us a while to figure out why this wasn't working. 
## Parts you're most proud of:
We are proud that we were able to create a design that is a good blend of intuitive, minimalistic and not overcrowded while still having all the required features and having these features be discoverable. This allowed us to give the actual todo list the most emphasis, as this is the main feature of the website. We were able to do this by minimizing the amount of buttons and creating a clean look. We also like how all the colors fit together. We decided to use different shades of a similar green and we think it ended up looking very nice. We are also proud of the font choice, especially considering how long it took us to get there.
We also are proud that we were able to actualize all our final design plans into html and css code. It is cool that we were able to take our original abstract design ideas into drawings on paper and finally into the computer. We were able to go through this process from start to finish and we are proud of that.
